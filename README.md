## The Espresso Shop

The motivation for this project was to create an online prescene for a Restaurant. In this project, a REST API is used to Create / Edit and Delete items from the Menu. In addition, the admin section uses JSON Web Tokens and Passport in order to access the routes for adding and editing items.
